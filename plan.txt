plan



1 Stop all sounds from Jak 2 that arent jetboard
2 Post location of Jak 1 jak only when we are off the board

If R2 is pushed post Jak 2 postion to server

Do math on server to find out if they are far away

If far away move jak 2 jak to the location of jak 1 jak

Dynamic level load system SHOULD make sure that jak 2 jak doesnt die

Just note that Jak 2 jak doesnt have water, this will cause bugs that we can ignore - add collision in blender later

Start posting Jak 2 jak position to server while on-board? is true

Make a local on-board-done-init? value

If this value is NOT true, run some extra code to spawn a platform under jak etc and set the value to true

If Jak 2 position is different than Jak 1 jaks current position locally, move him to Jak 2 position

Maybe disable jak 1 inputs while on jetboard at least for now.

If R2 is pushed a second time, turn off on-board? local and turn off on-board-done-init?
